<h1>python</h1>
<h2>This is a high-level and general-purpose language that focuses on code readability. It's one of the most popular beginner languages because of its ease of use, wide application, active community, and freedom of use. Programmers can use it for object-oriented, structured, or functional tasks. Python has a comprehensive standard library, which has earned the language the title "batteries included." The libraries provide tools for many tasks, such as creating internet applications, graphical user interfaces, and data analytics.
    The ease of use of this language is because of its simple, less-cluttered syntax and grammar with freedom of methodology during programming. Unlike most languages, python uses English words instead of punctuation. It also has fewer exceptional cases and syntactic exceptions than C language. Employers can use it in information technology, engineering, professional services, and design. Python helps you work fast to integrate systems as a glue language. It's also a popular rapid application development (RAD) language. The following are some application areas of python:

<h1>java</h1>
<h2>Developers mostly use Java for web apps' back-end interfaces or general service application programming interfaces (APIs) enhanced by frameworks such as Spring and Dropwizard. Developers also use Java to create Android applications for mobiles. The Java virtual machine allows the language to run on many platforms. Scala and Kotlin also run on the java virtual machine, making all these languages compatible and necessary to develop mobile apps. Specialized industries such as cloud computing, the internet of elements, and enterprise architecture use Java.</h2>

<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<h2>This is the world's most popular programming language. Coders mainly use it on the world wide web to create web interfaces or websites. It can be an easy-to-learn language. Programmers may classify JavaScript as a high-level language, multi-paradigm, and just in time compiled. It features dynamic typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object orientation. JavaScript can be a significant enabler of website interactivity and richness. While HTML builds the foundation for websites, JavaScript drives the websites. JavaScript has a famous library called JQuery used by most websites.</h2>

<h1>C and C++</h1>
<h2>C is a low-level language. This means that it requires the programmer to understand the underlying computer hardware. High-level languages have abstracted the computer details. For example, when using a low-level language, your program can take care of memory management in the code. Typically, higher programming languages automate the process of memory management for computers.C++ came from C and is used to simplify programming, though it's still a low-level language. You can easily translate C programs to C++. In comparison, coders may use it for embedded systems, while C++ is better structured for application development. Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ in 1985, 13 years after the invention of C. C and C++ are one of the earliest programming languages, which means learning these languages can place you as an essential employee even as time changes. </h2>

<h1>SQL</h1>
<h2>Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to query data. Computers send the SQL data queries to a server that responds with the requested data. SQL allows you to retrieve, insert, update, delete, and create data within a database. There are many variants of SQL and all variants have several similarities.SQL database servers are useful in websites and apps in storing information such as a user's posts and profiles. SQL jobs and career opportunities include high-paying jobs in business intelligence and data science. </h2>
